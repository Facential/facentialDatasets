* files, code, image, etc used for making our own datasets that will be fed to train the machine learning model

In order to make labeling becomes easy and less time consuming the notebook named highlightedTools.ipnyb are coded to automate this task. So rather than moving the image one by one from original folder to filtered and labeled folder we made this notebook to have a button that can copy the image automatically to separate folder based on that image class
